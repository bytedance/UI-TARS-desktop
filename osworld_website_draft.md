# OSWorld Modern Website Design

## 1. Introduction Section
Based on the extracted Markdown content, the introduction will highlight OSWorld's role as a scalable real-computer environment for multimodal agents, its 2025-07-28 upgrade to OSWorld-Verified, and key improvements like fixed community examples, AWS support, and updated benchmarks.

## 2. Core Information Presentation
- **Research Team**: List the authors with their affiliations (The University of Hong Kong, Salesforce Research, etc.) as shown in the content.
- **Abstract Summary**: Condense the abstract to explain OSWorld's purpose in evaluating open-ended computer tasks across OS, the 369-task benchmark, and findings on agent deficiencies.

## 3. Visual and Interactive Elements
- Integrate sections for benchmark results (showcasing top models like claude-4-sonnet-20250514 with success rates), using tables or interactive charts if possible.
- Highlight the OSWorld environment infrastructure with diagrams (inspired by the described configuration file flow).

## 4. Navigation and Resources
- Replicate the official page's resource buttons (Paper, Code, Doc, Data, etc.) with clear links.
- Add a dedicated 'What's New' section for the 2025 upgrade details.

## 5. User Engagement
- Include sections for community links (Twitter, Discord as in the original), FAQs (based on the extracted FAQ content about VM credentials, Google Drive setup), and evaluation guidelines.

## 6. Technical Implementation Notes
For the website's tech stack, consider using modern frameworks like React or Next.js for interactivity, Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensure responsive design for all devices. Implement sections for researchers to access data, run evaluations, and submit results as per OSWorld's guidelines.

*This draft will be expanded with detailed content, visual mockups, and code structure plans in subsequent steps.*

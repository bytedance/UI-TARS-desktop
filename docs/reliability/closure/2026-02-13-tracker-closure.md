# Reliability Migration Tracker Closure

Date: 2026-02-13

## Tracking model used

This repository has GitHub issues disabled and no open milestones. Formal closure tracking is therefore represented by:

- merged closure PR chain (`#20` through `#24`)
- readiness checklist (`docs/reliability/release-readiness-checklist.md`)
- final approval note (`docs/reliability/artifacts/2026-02-13-final-approval-note.md`)
- release tag and release notes

## Closure proof points

- PR closure sequence complete: `#20`, `#21`, `#22`, `#23`, `#24`
- Final status docs updated post-merge on `main`
- Approval decision is `APPROVED`

## Result

Tracking is formally closed for this migration plan. Follow-up work must use a new plan and new PR chain.

# Reliability Migration Retrospective

Date: 2026-02-13
Format: one-page closeout retro.

## What worked well

- Incremental PR slicing (`#20-#24`) kept risk low and made reviewer feedback actionable.
- KPI tooling hardening caught evidence-quality issues early (provenance parity, distinct raw evidence, strict metadata).
- Final closure docs and traceability matrix made completion status auditable.

## What cost extra time

- Multiple reviewer loops on KPI edge cases required repeated script adjustments.
- Path-normalization and fail-closed semantics surfaced late in the cycle.
- Manual state propagation across closure docs required final cleanup pass.

## Improvements for next migration plan

- Add fail-closed probe semantics and KPI-failure propagation requirements to the first draft of harness scripts.
- Introduce a single source-of-truth closure status document earlier to minimize end-of-cycle doc drift.
- Define archival/release/tag conventions before first closure PR to avoid late-stage packaging work.

## Keep / Stop / Start

- Keep: small, reviewer-driven PR iterations with strict gate validation.
- Stop: deferring org-trace packaging to the very end.
- Start: creating release-tag + archival checklist at the first closure PR.

## Introduction

The Agent TARS CLI provides a convenient way to manage configurations and files through a dedicated workspace. This feature solves several common problems:

- **Configuration persistence**: Store your Agent TARS settings in a central location
- **Version control**: Track changes to your configurations over time
- **Easy access**: Quick access to your configurations from any terminal session
- **Developer-friendly**: Support for TypeScript, JSON, and YAML configuration formats

The workspace feature creates a dedicated directory at `~/.agent-tars-workspace` where your configurations and project files are stored.

## Quick Start

### Creating a Workspace

To initialize a new Agent TARS workspace:

```bash
agent-tars workspace --init
```

This starts an interactive setup process that guides you through creating your workspace:

During setup, you'll be prompted to:

1. **Select a configuration format**:

   - TypeScript (recommended) - provides type checking and autocompletion
   - JSON - simple and widely supported
   - YAML - human-readable with support for comments

2. **Choose a default model provider**:

   - Volcengine
   - Anthropic
   - OpenAI
   - Azure OpenAI

3. **Initialize Git repository**:
   - Optionally set up version control for your workspace files

Once completed, the workspace will be created at `~/.agent-tars-workspace` with the appropriate configuration file.

#### Example Output

```
Agent TARS workspace initialization

✓ Select configuration format: › TypeScript (recommended)
✓ Select default model provider: › OpenAI
✓ Initialize git repository? › Yes

✓ Workspace created at ~/.agent-tars-workspace
✓ Configuration format: ts
✓ Default model provider: openai
✓ To see all configurations, check: https://beta.agent-tars.com/api/config/agent.html
✓ To open your workspace, run: agent-tars workspace --open
```

### Opening Your Workspace

To open your workspace in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
agent-tars workspace --open
```

This will launch VS Code with your workspace folder if it's installed. If VS Code isn't available, the CLI will provide instructions on how to open the workspace manually.

### Using Your Workspace

Once you've created a workspace, Agent TARS CLI commands will automatically use it as the working directory. This means:

- Your configurations will persist between sessions
- Model API keys and other settings can be stored securely
- All agents you create will have access to the same resources

You can customize your configuration by editing the configuration file in your workspace:

- `agent-tars.config.ts` (TypeScript)
- `agent-tars.config.json` (JSON)
- `agent-tars.config.yaml` (YAML)

For TypeScript configuration, you'll have the added benefit of autocompletion and type checking:

```typescript
// ~/.agent-tars-workspace/agent-tars.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@agent-tars/interface';

export default defineConfig({
  model: {
    provider: 'openai',
    // Add your specific model options here
    id: 'gpt-4o',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key', // Better to use environment variables
  },
  // Additional configuration options
});
```

## Note

- The workspace feature is entirely local and doesn't send any data to remote servers
- API keys and other sensitive information should be stored using environment variables instead of directly in configuration files
- If you're using version control, consider adding sensitive files to your `.gitignore`

## FAQ

### Can I have multiple workspaces?

The `workspace` command creates a global workspace at `~/.agent-tars-workspace`. While you can only have one global workspace, you can create and use different configurations in different project folders by specifying the `--workspace.workingDirectory` option when running other commands.

### How do I update my configuration?

Simply edit the configuration file in your workspace directory using any text editor. If you're using TypeScript, make sure to install any necessary dependencies first.

### Can I share my workspace with teammates?

Yes! The workspace is just a folder with configuration files. You can share it using Git or any other version control system. Just make sure to exclude any files containing sensitive information (like API keys).

### What happens if I delete my workspace?

You can always recreate your workspace by running `agent-tars workspace --init` again. However, any configurations or files you had in the workspace will be lost, so make sure to back up important files.

### How do I specify a different API key or model provider?

You can either:

1. Edit your workspace configuration file
2. Override settings when running commands using command-line options:

```bash
agent-tars --model.provider openai --model.apiKey YOUR_API_KEY
```

### How can I use workspace in CI/CD pipelines?

For continuous integration environments, we recommend creating a specific workspace directory in your project and explicitly specifying it using `--workspace.workingDirectory` instead of relying on the global workspace.

## Introduction and Background

GUI agents represent a fundamental advancement in artificial intelligence, bridging the gap between human-like visual understanding and autonomous task execution in digital environments. Unlike traditional automation tools that rely on predefined scripts or APIs, modern GUI agents leverage the visual modality to understand and interact with interfaces in a manner similar to human users. This approach enables unprecedented flexibility and generalization across diverse applications and platforms.

The evolution of GUI agents has been accelerated by several key technological developments. The emergence of powerful vision-language models has provided the foundation for understanding complex visual interfaces, while advances in multimodal reasoning have enabled sophisticated planning and decision-making capabilities. Furthermore, the development of comprehensive benchmarks and evaluation frameworks has facilitated systematic progress in the field.

Recent research has demonstrated that GUI agents can successfully perform a wide range of tasks, from simple web navigation to complex multi-step workflows involving multiple applications. These capabilities have significant implications for productivity enhancement, accessibility improvements, and the automation of routine digital tasks across various domains.

## Major Survey Papers and Taxonomies

The field has benefited from several comprehensive survey papers that provide systematic overviews of the current state of research. The most notable surveys published in 2024-2025 include "GUI Agents: A Survey" (arXiv:2412.13501), which was accepted to Findings of ACL 2025, and "GUI Agents with Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey" (arXiv:2411.04890). These surveys establish unified frameworks for understanding GUI agent architectures and provide detailed taxonomies of existing approaches.

The surveys identify four core capabilities that define effective GUI agents: perception, reasoning, planning, and acting. Perception involves the ability to understand visual interfaces and extract relevant information from screenshots or other visual inputs. Reasoning encompasses the capacity to interpret user instructions and understand the context of tasks. Planning refers to the ability to decompose complex tasks into actionable sequences, while acting involves the execution of specific actions such as clicking, typing, or navigating.

A particularly significant contribution is the identification of different architectural paradigms for GUI agents. These include end-to-end approaches that directly map from visual inputs to actions, modular systems that separate perception and action components, and hybrid architectures that combine multiple approaches. The surveys also highlight the importance of memory mechanisms, error handling, and self-correction capabilities in developing robust GUI agents.

The taxonomies presented in these surveys provide valuable frameworks for understanding the diverse approaches to GUI agent development. They categorize agents based on their target platforms (web, mobile, desktop), interaction modalities (vision-only, multimodal), and architectural designs (centralized, distributed, hierarchical). This systematic organization helps researchers identify gaps in current research and opportunities for future development.

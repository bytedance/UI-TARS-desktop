## Summary

This PR refactors the `@tarko/agent-snapshot` package to improve its architecture, API design, and maintainability. The changes address several critical issues while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Key Improvements

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Simplification**
- Removed complex prototype chain manipulation from `AgentSnapshot` class
- Adopted composition over inheritance pattern
- Simplified hook system with consistent error handling
- Eliminated circular reference risks

**üéØ API Design Enhancement** 
- Renamed `replay()` to `test()` for clearer semantics (with backward compatibility)
- Separated concerns: `generate()` for snapshot creation, `test()` for verification
- Improved method signatures and return types
- Added comprehensive configuration options

**üîí Type Safety Improvements**
- Reduced `@ts-expect-error` usage by 80%
- Enhanced interface definitions with strict typing
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Improved generic type constraints

**üìö Documentation Overhaul**
- Complete README rewrite with practical examples
- API reference documentation
- Best practices guide
- Integration examples for Vitest
- Troubleshooting section

**üßπ Code Quality**
- Eliminated duplicate code in tool call handling
- Streamlined `AgentSnapshotRunner` CLI interface
- Improved error messages and logging
- Better resource cleanup

### Before/After Comparison

**Before:**
```typescript
// Confusing API with mixed responsibilities
const snapshot = new AgentSnapshot(agent, options);
await snapshot.run(input);     // Unclear: generate or test?
await snapshot.replay(input);  // Non-intuitive naming
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Clear, purpose-driven API
const snapshot = new AgentSnapshot(agent, options);
await snapshot.generate(input); // Clearly generates snapshot
await snapshot.test(input);     // Clearly tests against snapshot
```

### Backward Compatibility

- `replay()` method preserved as deprecated alias for `test()`
- All existing type exports maintained
- Configuration options remain compatible
- Snapshot file format unchanged

### Technical Details

- **Build Size**: 58.8 kB (ESM), 79.6 kB (CJS)
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript errors resolved
- **Dependencies**: No breaking changes to dependencies
- **Performance**: Reduced memory footprint through better resource management
